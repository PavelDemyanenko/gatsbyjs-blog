New technologies social disruption spreads to every sector in the economy, so too have the industry’s favorite competitive ritual, hackathons.

The contests, where small teams of “hackers” build tech products in marathon all-night coding sessions, are a hallmark of Silicon Valley culture. Recall Facebook’s most famous hackathon, thrown on the eve of its IPO to show the world that the demands of being a public company would not kill the “hacker way” at One Hacker Way. Even New York Fashion Week and the Vatican have hosted hackathons. They’ve become part of a “toolkit” for large organizations seeking a veneer of innovation.

In Budapest T-Systems hold a YAM-Hackathon. This event is meant to evangelize company’s technology platforms, and simply to be associated with something cool and techie.

It is a “powerful strategy for manufacturing workers’ consent in the ‘new’ economy.” In other words, institutions use the allure of hackathons, with prizes, snacks, and potential for career advancement!

As for me the main point of a hackathon is that I can get experience which I can't get in the project, and I believe skills learned at a hackathon will help me to get job promotion. We will see, I will write about it in my blog.

Some people note that such events, in which employees may feel obligated to participate, are a form of labor control. “They’re just trying to squeeze the innovation out of [their workers],” they say.

Thats not quite true for YAM Hackathon.
